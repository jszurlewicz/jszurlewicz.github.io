## üë®‚Äçüíº About Me
Hello! My name is **Juan Ignacio Szurlewicz** and I‚Äôm from Argentina. I'm a **young economist, data analyst, and data scientist** with over **2 years of experience** in the data field.

During this time, I've worked as a consultant for a leading consulting firm in Argentina, where I contributed to various **S&OP (Sales and Operations Planning)** and **IBP (Integrated Business Planning)** projects. My work involved delivering valuable solutions to clients in the **retail industry**, primarily in Brazil.

I primarily used **Pyplan**, the proprietary library and IDE developed by the company, which is based on Python. This platform enabled us to develop and deploy complex models tailored to our clients' needs.

## üöÄ Key Projects

- **üìä Demand Planning Forecast**: Developed a predictive model for demand forecasting that improved the accuracy of the demand plan by 20% for a major retail client in Brazil.

- **üìä Master Production Schedule**: Created an integrated production planning model linked to the demand forecast module. This model enabled the construction of a more accurate production schedule, identifying production gaps, resource needs, and costs associated with obsolete products.

- **üìä Material Requirements Planning**: Designed a material procurement model integrated with the production planning module to create a restricted plan. This model reduced material expirations and improved purchase forecasting by adjusting input orders according to changes in production needs.

- **üìä Vendor Management Inventory**: Enhanced stock out and days on hand metrics for franchise stores using a Vendor Management Inventory model. This model optimized purchasing based on desired stock days, configured for lead times and transit times, and included analysis of excess inventory and obsolescence.
